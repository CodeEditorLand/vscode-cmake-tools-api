# CMake Tools API sample extension

This extension is made to provide an example for how to interact with the CMake Tools API.

It primarily utilizes the handlers that are available that react to various changes in the CMake Tools extension. For example, when the code model changes, when the configuration is changed, or when the active folder is changed.
